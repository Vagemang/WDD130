    <p>Hello! My name is Vanessa. Iâ€™m a university student studying Petrochemical Engineering at KNUST. Iâ€™m passionate about renewable energy, technology, and using innovative ideas to solve real-world problems, especially in my home country, Ghana. I enjoy working on creative projects that combine science and community service, like building smart energy systems and teaching young students about sustainability. In my free time, I love writing, learning new tech skills, and finding new ways to grow and help others. My goal is to make a lasting impact in the world by using my knowledge to bring positive change to people's lives.</p>
